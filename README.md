Tailwind CSS is already set up in the project. If you need to modify the configuration, you can find it in `tailwind.config.js`.

If you're setting up Tailwind in a new project, follow these steps:

1. Install Tailwind via npm:

   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   ```

2. Create the necessary configuration files:

   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```

3. Add the following to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

   ```js
   module.exports = {
     content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx}"],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   };
   ```

4. In your `src/index.css`, add the following lines:

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```
